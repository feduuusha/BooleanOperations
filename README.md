# BooleanOperations

The "Boolean Operations" console application was created by me to optimize work with logical functions. At the moment, there is no such application on the Internet that would provide me with the necessary tools to work with logical functions

The application provides opportunities to work with functions written explicitly (example: (!X1 & X2) | X3), and also with functions written as a vector (example: 1000 0001).

You can explicitly write the function using '!' - negation, '&' - conjunction, '|' - disjunction

## Application possibilities
* Building a truth table of a logical function
* Construction of FDNF (full disjunctive normal form)
* Construction of FCNF (full conjunctive normal form)
* Construction of an abbreviated DNF (disjunctive normal form)
* Construction of a dead-end DNF (disjunctive normal form)
* Building a Quine table
* Construction of a minimal DNF (disjunctive normal form)
* Construction of the Zhegalkin polynomial

## Application requirements
* Installed Java 11+ 
## How to use the application

2. Launch the console
3. Go to the folder with the JAR file
4. Run the command: java -jar BooleanOperations.jar
5. Use the App
